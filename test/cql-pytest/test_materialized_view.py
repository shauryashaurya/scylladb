# an over-64KB value. Ideally, such a write should fail cleanly with an
# InvalidQuery.
# But today, neither Cassandra nor Scylla does this correctly. Both do not
# detect the problem at the coordinator level, and both send the writes to the
# replicas and fail the view update in each replica. The user's write may or
# may not fail depending on whether the view update is done synchronously
# (Scylla, sometimes) or asynchrhonously (Casandra). But even in the failure
# case the failure does not explain why the replica writes failed - the only

# Here too Scylla generates a long list of view updates (individual row
# deletions), and if it's split into smaller batches, this needs to be
# done correctly and no view update missed.
# This test is related to issue #17117 - it doesn't reproduce that issue
# (we have reproducers for it above), but it's important to confirm that
# after fixing that issue, we don't break this case and can still split
# a large clustering prefix deletion into multiple batches without losing
# any view deletions.
